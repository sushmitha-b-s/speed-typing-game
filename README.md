The speed typing game is the front-end application where the users can test how many words they can type in a minute. This is an enjoyable game and it challenges you the most. Do you want to give it a try? Click on the above link and get started ðŸ˜‰.

## Technologies used

- HTML5, CSS, SASS/SCSS, JavaScript, React, React Hooks.

## Goal of this project

- This is a very small project with lot of fun and a challenge, which helped me to get a better understanding of React Hooks.

## Features

- The time limit is set to 60 seconds.
- Once the user clicks the start button, the textbox immediately gets the autofocus, time limit starts and the user can start the game by typing anyhting he/she wishes.
- The user will not be able to select the text from the textbox.
- The user will not be able to use cut, copy or paste inside the textbox. All are disabled.
- When the time limit ends (i.e, 60 sec), the result will be showed beside 'WORD COUNT' in WPM (words per minute).
